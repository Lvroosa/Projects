# Business Analytics Practicum Project

I included my project presentation and code to showcase our findings regarding BTS' data on Spotify

In this project, our goal was to inform BTS' label, HYBE, of their recent popularity from 2019-2021 and provide data-driven recommendations for tour locations, setlist
strategies, budget allocations, and collaboration opportunities. 

The Spotify dataset that my team used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts 

You can find our presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LM8if6JyuBvRmr4JiWQEqpTvsapHo6berhHbBW5MarM/edit?usp=sharing. 

Outside of our data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, we performed K-Means clustering to find the countries where collaboration was most important to make it onto the top 200.
