# Business Analytics Practicum Project: Recommendations For BTS

In this project, our goal was to inform BTS' label, HYBE, of their recent popularity from 2019-2021 and provide data-driven recommendations for tour locations, setlist strategies, budget allocations, and collaboration opportunities.

The Spotify dataset that my team used for our analysis can be found here.

You can find our presentation here.

Outside of our data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, we performed K-Means clustering to find the countries where collaboration was most important to make it onto the top 200.

Our tools used for data analysis were R and Tableau.
